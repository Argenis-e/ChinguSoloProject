Hello, this is my Solo Chingu Project, **"Virtual Slime Pet"**.

It is not as polished as I would like it to, but I feel like I still managed to fulfill the requirements and functionality asked with a short amount of time and almost no recollection of HTML/CSS, Javascript.

**What is your app/project called?**
Virtual Slime Pet!

**Overview — Why did you start this project?**
Thank you for checking out my solo project! :)
Out of all the projects there were, this is the one that really caught my attention.
Plus, I started this project because I want to get some real world experience developing code and found Chingu, which helps with just that, but to join the group I had to develop this project completely Solo.

**Features — What are some key things your project can do?**
The game has a sort of timer, that starts since the very first prompt asking for the pet's name, 10 seconds after the prompt is shown, the game will start and days will pass every 2.5 seconds. With each day, the pet's stats are affected, health is decreased, hunger is increased and happiness is also decreased by a random number.
There are buttons to interact with your pet, they are displayed as "Feed!", "Clean!" and "Play!", each will affect the pet's stats each time the user clicks any of them.
Be careful, if your pet's health goes to 0, you will receive a message saying it has died and that the game will restart.
If you want to start over, there is the "Restart the game!" button that will set your current pet's stats to default. (Mind that this will not change your pet's name, for that you have to close the tab and open it in a new browser.

**Running the project — How could someone else get your code working for them?**
Download the files, put all the scripts in the same directory and that's it!
Just double click the "index.html" file and your game will open in your preferred browser.

**Dependencies — What are the main outside resources your project needs to run?**
This project has no dependencies, it does not even import libraries to use. This is plain vanilla HTML/CSS, Javascript.
